I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Renewable Energy and Clean Energy at North China Electric Power University (NCEPU), where I also completed my undergraduate studies in New Energy Science and Engineering. My main focus during my undergraduate studies is wind power generation, and I am fortunate to secure a recommendation for graduate study based on my top-ranked comprehensive performance.

Under the guidance of Prof. [Yan Jie](https://xnyxy.ncepu.edu.cn/szdw/jsdw/js/a772f64a44804b10b0505e4015b66484.htm), my current research focuses on the application of deep learning in power systems, particularly in the **wind power forecasting(WPF)**. My research is dedicated to addressing the challenge of multi-source data fusion for source and load forecasting. In the information age, where data is increasingly important, my work aims to explore how to share data information while protecting data privacy, which is significant for improving the effectiveness of deep learning models. This is especially relevant in future power markets, where the coupling modeling of household electricity consumption, distributed photovoltaic power generation, and centralized wind and solar power stations in cities inevitably involves data privacy issues. Specifically, I am exploring a universal deep learning framework that implements integrated modeling of renewable energy combined with load, especially flexible load, through techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption.

**_ðŸ”´ I am actively looking for a PhD position in 2025 Fall. Iâ€™m open to any meaningful research topics during my doctoral studies._**
